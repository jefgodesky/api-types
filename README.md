The _Ruins & Revolutions_ API provides programmatic access to
the catalogue of scales, scrolls, tables, and other items that
_Ruins & Revolutions_ players have developed and shared with
the community.

This is a central repository of Typescript
types and interfaces used by the API, which
you can use for any consumer of the API that
youâ€™re writing in Typescript.
